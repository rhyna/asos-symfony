# asos-symfony

The most recent and thorough project Iâ€™ve made. 
It's a product catalog (I used the ASOS store website as a reference), made with the use of Symfony and Doctrine. 
The main functionality includes a client-side app and an admin app with the possibility to manage products, their brands, categories, sizes, advertising banners, and users of the admin app. The client-side contains a catalog of products organized by categories and brands, a catalog of brands, various filters in them, product pages with a photo gallery and the information on a product, and a simple search engine to search through products. 
The admin app has authorization, functionality to add, edit and delete products, their brands, categories, sizes, and advertising banners from the client side.
